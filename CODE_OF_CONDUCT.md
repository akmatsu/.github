# Code of Conduct

**TL;DR:** Stay on topic and don't be a jerk. This space is for working on the projects hosted here. Other discussions are not appropriate.

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to on-topic development channels of the project, including but not limited to:
- Bug trackers.
- Development repositories.
- Mailing lists.
- Any other communication method for development of software.

This code of conduct is only applicible to behavior outside project spaces if it directly disrupts collaboration. We do not enforce this code of conduct based on personal opinions expressed outside project spaces.

Off-topic channels are subject to their own rules and guidelines.

## Standards of Communication

We expect all users to stay on-topic while using development channels.

We will not accept the following:
- Stalking and witchhunting
- Doxing
- Prolonged arguments or off-topic debates.
- Ad hominems
- Attempts to flame or derail communication
- Trolling and Troll Feeding

If you see misbehaviour, ignore the person(s) and speak with a moderator or administrator.

## Why this exists
This code of conduct exists to keep this space focused and productive. It is a general guide and a warning: disruptive behavior and distractions won't be tolerated.
